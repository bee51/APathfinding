  # Unity A* Pathfinding Project

This project implements the A* pathfinding algorithm in Unity, allowing for efficient pathfinding in a 2D or 3D game environment.

## Features

- A* pathfinding algorithm implementation
- Grid-based navigation system
- Support for both 2D and 3D environments
- Adjustable grid size and node costs
- Start and target position selection
- Path visualization in the Unity editor
- Smooth movement along the generated path

## Demo

Include a GIF or video showcasing the project's functionality and pathfinding in action.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Recommended Unity version 2022.3.3 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/bee51/APathfinding.git
2. Open the project in Unity.

## Usage

1. Open the scene containing the A* pathfinding implementation.
2. Set up your game environment with obstacles, start position, and target position.
3. Press the play button in the Unity editor.
4. The algorithm will calculate the shortest path and display it in the scene.
5. The agent will move along the generated path towards the target position.

## Configuration

You can customize the following parameters in the A* pathfinding script:

- Grid size: Adjust the size of the grid used for navigation.
